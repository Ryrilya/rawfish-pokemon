# Rawfish Pokédex
This project was commissioned by [Rawfish](https://rawfish.com/) and its purpose is to test my skills in order to get the job for the position I applied.

## About the project
Rawfish asked me to create a web app with Vue.js or React.js that emulates a Pokédex with [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/).

#### Requirements
* **Retrieve the data** from the API and show an **infinite list** of pokémon
* Show, per each pokémon, its:
  * Name
  * Image
  * At least 1 ability
* **Full Responsive** (Smartphone, Desktop)
* **Well-written code** and **project clearness**

#### Nice to have features
* Show 50 elements per page (pagination)
* Create a details page of the selected pokémon in the list, showing a major number of info, such as its abilities, the species, evolution chain, and so on...
